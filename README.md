# Travel Tracker ✈️
Travel tracker is a web application that allows users to view and add trips. It also allows them to keep track of their yearly travel expenses.

## Setup:
To get started, you'll need to `git clone` both the [back end repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api) and the [front end repo](https://github.com/ivonne-hernandez/travel-tracker), `cd` into each directory, and run the following:

```bash
npm install
```
and 
```bash
npm start
```

After you run `npm start` on the back end you should see the following:

```bash
Travel Tracker API is now running on http://localhost:3001
```
After you run `npm start` on the front end you should see the following:

```bash
webpack 5.38.1 compiled successfully
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to start using the app.
